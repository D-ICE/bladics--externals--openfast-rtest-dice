 FAST_Solution0:CalcOutputs_And_SolveForInputs:SolveOption2:SrvD_CalcOutput:DLL_controller_call:Run
 ning with torque and pitch control of the NREL offshore 5MW baseline wind turbine from DISCON.dll
 as written by J. Jonkman of NREL/NWTC for use in the IEA Annex XXIII OC3 studies.


 FAST_Solution:FAST_AdvanceStates:SrvD_UpdateStates:DLL_controller_call:BladedInterface option was
 designed for an explicit-loose coupling scheme. Using last calculated values from DLL on all
 subsequent calls until time is advanced. Warning will not be displayed again.
